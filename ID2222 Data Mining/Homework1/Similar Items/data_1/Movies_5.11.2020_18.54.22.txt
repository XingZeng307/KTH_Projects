After seeing the movie on BET recently it brought back all of the good memories relating to the actors and the musicians and I went searching to buy a copy. product/productId: B00004CQT4 review/userId: AVQRC2N2SSSYS review/profileName: Mark A.

Plus, Dennis Leary is great and "Duff" from MTV (VJ around 1990-91) also makes a cameo.....very cute! I would recommend this movie for anyone that was a young adult around 1993 or to someone who wants a good laugh.<br /><br />MJ product/productId: B00004CQT4 review/userId: A2ON9S58W4AZ1Z review/profileName: Kindra review/helpfulness: 0/0 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1012435200 review/summary: A Classic! review/text: This is a great movie especially if you were a young adult during the early 90's.  Dr. Dre and Ed Lover are a great pair, very funny.  Dennis Leary is hysterical.  So many quotable quotes!  The parade of rap stars actually enhances the movie. It's not a serious movie, more like really long funny skit. product/productId: B00004CQT4 review/userId: A3IG9WGCIHPJ6X review/profileName: *** "AC1962" review/helpfulness: 0/1 review/score: 4.0 review/time: 1127952000 review/summary: Not an Oscar contender review/text: Though it was never an Oscar contender, it was funny as h***!!! product/productId: B006JIUN2W review/userId: A44YJ6ZLTMAR6 review/profileName: Manoj Sharma review/helpfulness: 1/1 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1335312000 review/summary: Deep, wide-ranging Phonics coverage review/text: This video covers phonics to a deep extent, and may be a little too much for beginners.<br />Mouth movement is included, and is an extremely useful learning tool. Occasionally, however, they just show the lip movement without showing pictures of the object corresponding to the word.<br />Nevertheless, my son is a fast learner so it worked out perfectly for us. A hidden gem.
