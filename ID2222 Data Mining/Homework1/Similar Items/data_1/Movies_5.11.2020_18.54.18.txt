This is not the typical &quot;A-boy-and-his-pet&quot; film. The story is more realistic than the typical film of its genre such as &quot;Flipper&quot; or  &quot;Lassie&quot; and lacks the obvious manipulations of an &quot;Air  Bud.&quot; The characters look like real people. (Watch how Angus' little  brother dresses himself. Anyone who has been around a six-year old can see  their child dressing like this). Angus's and Yellow's fight through the  wilderness is not glossed over or &quot;Disneyfied.&quot; The  cinematography is beautiful. This film is wonderful for the whole family,  not just for the six-year old. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A2IMLPUXYQJTSY review/profileName: Jerry Loveless "jerryl3515" review/helpfulness: 7/7 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1146960000 review/summary: Excellent Family Movie review/text: As owners of a Yellow Lab, we just might be a bit biased, but we were mesmerized by this movie.<br /><br />The adventures of a lost boy and dog.  Of course the ending is predictable.  We knew that.  But the story line, the fabulous scenery, the cinematography, the acting, the sub-plots and the adventure make this a must-see movie for the whole family - Preview it before showing it to the very young; they might be traumatized by the scary parts.<br /><br />Buy "Far From Home..."  a guaranteed winner.  You'll be watching it over and over again. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A1D12NAC1U12F0 review/profileName: Frank J.

A young boy takes in a lost Yellow lab, and despite his parents reservations allow him to keep the dog. The boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island. The dog stays by the young boy's side as they struggle to survive, find food, and battle a pack of wolves. All this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him.<br /><br /> After many weeks pass the Coast Guard believes they may never be found, but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each others love and devotion. It has an unusual ending, which I don't want to spoil, but Yellow Dog is one movie, although simple in structure, that really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A3RVH9HUN9J4LZ review/profileName: Michael review/helpfulness: 1/1 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1248825600 review/summary: A movie for all ages review/text: You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film.  This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy.  It has something for everyone.  Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama.  A few scary moments for the young ones, but nothing they can't handle.  A few sprinkles of romance.  Lots of dog-boy bonding.  The ending is predictable for all but the very young, but delightful nonetheless.  Best of all, it's just a delightful movie free of violence, car chases, shoot-outs and antagonists!  This movie was engaging from start to finish.  On par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V3A">The Journey of Natty Gann</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ZXSI">A Walk in the Clouds</a>. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: AH7ZNGM8WOOGN review/profileName: Gary E.
