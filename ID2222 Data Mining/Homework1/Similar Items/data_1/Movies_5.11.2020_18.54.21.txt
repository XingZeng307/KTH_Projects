He's just finishing up a nice canoe.  And when he finds a stray dog, he adopts him and names him Yellow.<br /><br />Taking a few days off from school to accompany his dad, John (Bruce Davison), on a supply run seems like a dream come true.  But when they encounter a fierce storm, the boat they are in capsizes.  John is quickly rescued, but the search and rescue teams can't find any trace of Angus or Yellow.<br /><br />The two have survives and are trying to find their way back to civilization.  Will they be able to survive and be reunited with their family?<br /><br />This movie is fairly standard and innocuous family fare.  It is a little slow at times, especially in the beginning while things are set up.  It is fairly predictable.  But it is entertaining.  Kids will enjoy it more than their parents.  My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes.  Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly, never giving any plot point time to be fully developed.  At the same time, I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying.<br /><br />The film could have been much better but does grow on you.  Don't rush out to see it, but there's no reason to avoid it either. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A3GX0UO7XXZST2 review/profileName: Rob Hobbs review/helpfulness: 3/5 review/score: 4.0 review/time: 1034035200 review/summary: Good Family Movie review/text: Our family really enjoys this movie.  The story is not terribly predictable and the actors all do a solid job.  Beautiful scenery and enough action to keep the little ones engaged.  Should be on DVD.  We'll add it to our collection. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A2942G3FDOIM18 review/profileName: Vicki D.

It was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion.  Being an animal lover I was pulling for the happy ending (of Course).  I am Disney's biggest fan and I love this movie right along with the others. (P.S.  I am a Grandmother to eleven.)  Thank heavens for Disney Movies. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A11L5M4MJP00UW review/profileName: David L Hutchins "Music Lover" review/helpfulness: 2/6 review/score: 3.0 review/time: 1168473600 review/summary: Disappointing review/text: I love dogs and I really wanted to love this film.  Unfortunately I didn't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but perhaps I didn't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this.  Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds.  Also it seemed that they didn't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog. (The movie is short; not even 1 1/2 hours.) It's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring.  The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog can't be rescued, but don't worry as it has a happy ending.  It's an okay movie, but I expected a lot more.  I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy (like Shrek II).  This is definately one mainly just for the kids.  So many things that kids can't or shouldn't watch.  This is one that anyone can watch, which is a big plus.  Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A2VDM3D712BGLE review/profileName: Elizabeth LaRosa review/helpfulness: 1/5 review/score: 1.0 review/time: 1262304000 review/summary: Truly bad but not the worst review/text: This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The acting wasn't good, it was very predictable, and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary. The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home, his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy. If you want predictable, watch a survival movie. What happens, almost always, is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident, they struggle to survive, they are found, and then brought home. "Far From Home" is no exception. As for unnecessary, the whole "romance" part of this movie was badly done and not needed. The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home, and all the while, the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse. Also some parts of this movie might upset young children, such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow can't be rescued. All in all, I would not advise anyone to see this movie; in fact, I would warn against it. product/productId: B00004CQT4 review/userId: A1NN07FHTQZZ6K review/profileName: Michele Adams review/helpfulness: 0/0
