review/text: I'm sorry to be such a Scrooge with Christmas rapidly approaching, but while watching Far From Home- The Adventures of Yellow Dog tonight, it sort of struck me as boring.  I was expecting a family-oriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of British Columbia, and the film delivers in that respect but... it just *barely* delivers.<br /><br />The entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90's adventure films.  A film that certainly LOOKS really good and I imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it, and I remember back in the mid 90's how these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them, but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking changes, I find a movie like this just isn't very fun to watch anymore.<br /><br />I can't remember if this film was produce by Disney but it definitely *feels* like it was.  My biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallow.<br /><br />Yes they collect bugs, kill animals when they get hungry enough, encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats, but... it's just not enough.  These segments feel undeveloped and uncreative.  It's just not enough entertainment and doesn't offer a darn thing as far as originality is concerned either.  It's completely missing anything TRULY enticing.<br /><br />Yes, the parents are worried that their teenage boy is missing.  Interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents (with the exception of one scene) that he might be dead.  It was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land.  I'd be flying planes over the ocean first.<br /><br />If that was MY son out there missing in the woods, you better believe I'd fear the worst.  Granted, there was one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him, but eh... that was just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger.  Not very appealing or accurate storytelling.<br /><br />The fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem, and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching ending, I've seen better.  Actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending, it would have been even better.<br /><br />Personally I feel Homeward Bound is a LOT better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival, but humor as well.  A much better movie than this one. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A1J50B4K22D93F review/profileName: Jack review/helpfulness: 0/0 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1314748800 review/summary: Amazing review/text: I have no words, really my wife would not stop mourn the end of the movie.intense, surprising, sad, happy, sentimental, inspiring, emotional, product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q review/profileName: Ranny Levy review/helpfulness: 0/0 review/score: 4.0 review/time: 1312156800 review/summary: Dog Lover's Will Adore This review/text: Are you a dog lover and into adventure? Then Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog, is the movie for you! This movie tells the story of a young boy named Angus who adopts a stray dog and names him Yellow. Angus, his father, and Yellow set sail one day, but a huge storm causes their boat to topple. Rescue teams are only able to find Angus' father. Stranded on an island far from civilization, Angus and Yellow's survival skills are put to the test. Will they get rescued? Watch this movie to find out! I liked this movie because it is a heartwarming tale. The movie builds anticipation in the rescue team's pursuit to find Angus and Yellow. I was especially impressed with Yellow's acting! His facial expressions and actions resemble that of a person's. I recommend this film for children ages 7 and up. The movie is an uplifting journey and is a splendid family film.

A dog finds a boy, boy keeps dog only if he takes complete care of him.  Dog, he names Yellow, becomes boys best friend.  A functional family teaching their son responsibility.  The scenery in this movie is beautiful. You will laugh, smile, and have tears....ending with joy.  Years ago we purchased this movie for ourselves after seeing it on HBO.  We have since purchased it for adults and for children. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: A174WE983H06N4 review/profileName: ZombiBoi review/helpfulness: 0/0 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1298937600 review/summary: Family entertainment that's not just for the kids review/text: The first time I viewed this film I was a young teen. Now as a 29 year old guy I find this film just as entertaining as I did all those years ago. In a nutshell this is a film about a boy and the dog who found him,changed him,and saved his life when they were both shipwrecked. This film will appeal to anyone from 5 to 95 who enjoy clean adventurous family films. product/productId: B00004CQT3 review/userId: ASES4LU7WKYC review/profileName: J. L.
