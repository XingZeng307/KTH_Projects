Harris "Film aficionado" review/helpfulness: 1/1 review/score: 3.0 review/time: 1327968000 review/summary: A Lavish Chinese Production That Ends Up Being A Soapy (And Pretty Loopy) Revenge Drama review/text: I had heard a lot of criticism leveled at Gao Xiaosong's "My Kingdom" complaining that its two disparate halves never really fit together into a cohesive narrative. The first part of the film strains for epic grandeur with its story of two orphans being trained in the art and honor of the Chinese opera (not the singing kind). One of the boys sees his family slaughtered in a political maneuver but is saved from imminent death by a wandering opera master and his charge. The three form a offbeat family unit which is threatened when their master is humiliated in a challenge with a Southern rival. The movie fast forwards until the boys are grown and ready to seek a form of retribution as they move into the popular Shanghai opera scene in the twenties. After this simple story is resolved, the second half of the film becomes a loopy bit of revenge fantasy. The screenplay twists and turns as secrets are revealed, implausibilities mount up, and characters have their ulterior motives exposed. It is chaotic (and tries way too hard), but at least it's fun.<br /><br />Many who have unfavorably judged "My Kingdom" tend to proclaim the first half as brilliant and the second half as the weak link. I, however, tend to disagree. I thought that the introductory premise was so thin and contrived that I never bought into the dramatic substance of the plot. Heck, two seconds after the boys arrive in Shanghai, they are greeted by a street parade extolling an upcoming performance of the man who bested their adoptive father 15 years previously. Hey, that was simple. These two vagabonds issue a challenge to the opera superstar that somehow gets newspaper coverage and makes them headliners in a opera duel. Hey, that was simple too. Now they are legends! Wow, that's a lot for their first day in town! After the duel, the boys must integrate themselves within the existing opera company that includes a defiant leading lady. As one steps into the spotlight and an illicit affair, the other seeks to avenge his family's murder from so many years ago. The remainder of the film plays as a twisty thriller that never feels particularly real. But as the convoluted plotting wraps around itself, I must admit to being amused by it all. It, for me, was far more entertaining than what had preceded it.<br /><br />The movie itself is elaborately staged. The battle sequences and opera numbers have a pleasing over-the-top quality. 1920's Shanghai is lush and gorgeous and the costuming is memorable. However, it all feels a little flat. The leads are attractive enough, but they lack a gravitas to convince us they can headline an intended epic. I understand they are known pop stars in their country, and that makes sense. The actor who plays a diabolical police investigator seems like he's about twelve and downplays the drama out of every scene. Ultimately, I think "My Kingdom" tries to accomplish too much. I personally wish they would have committed to making it an adult soap opera with no pretensions other than to entertain. As is, it's a bit of a mess. I probably liked it for the wrong reasons, but its loopiness is not without its charms. KGHarris, 1/12. product/productId: B0078V2LCY review/userId: A39M64IZTC04G0 review/profileName: David W.

And unlike many Chinese movies, it does not have a totally sad ending where everyone, especially the hero, gets killed! product/productId: B003ZG3GAM review/userId: ATK3QFC6L1318 review/profileName: J.

The only downside of the show was it only lasted two seasons.  I already bought the show in HD via Xbox Live.  Glad to see it on Amazon.com VOD.  I would have bought from here first if it was available at the time.  Wish show would come out on Blu-ray.  Season 2 even got better when the guys move out and get their own apartment.  Kevin Smith directed the pilot episode. Enjoy. product/productId: B004BH1TN0 review/userId: AWPODHOB4GFWL review/profileName: Martin A Hogan "Marty From SF" review/helpfulness: 34/35 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1012003200 review/summary: As Crisp As A Live Recording Can Be review/text: Recording with an audience of less than 1,000, this DVD feels like a club recording with it's Dolby Ditigal and DTS audio sound.  Host Mark McEwen gushes a tad much and the 'Live by Request' gimmick is not original.  Still, it manages to captivate.  Fifteen songs (one a medley of eight), five being from the last album, it's a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies.  &quot;She Keep On Coming&quot; and &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot; rock the house, while &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; and &quot;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; lull the audience into a trance.  This recording is unique in that there are plenty of star 'call-ins' and lots of joking around.  Its surprising to hear Barry sing, &quot;Woman In Love&quot;, but &quot;Nights On Broadway&quot; is, once again, cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best work.<p>This is as close as a great live recording gets and a DVD well worth owning.  &quot;One Night Only&quot; is a great live recording as well, but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation. product/productId: B004BH1TN0 review/userId: A1R6DF0KOJ0TG6 review/profileName: Rona review/helpfulness: 2/2 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1043712000 review/summary: Bee Gees - Live by Request review/text: This is an awesome concert because the Bee Gees are so relaxed and spontaneous!  It was even fun listening to the request call-ins.  Some of the women said the same things I would have said if I had been able to view it live.  Love those guys!! Also, they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts.  I highly recommend this DVD! product/productId: B004BH1TN0 review/userId: A9Q28YTLYREO7 review/profileName: A customer "mistermaxxx" review/helpfulness: 2/2 review/score: 4.0
