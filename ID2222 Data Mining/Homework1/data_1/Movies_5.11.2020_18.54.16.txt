It is done with class and a great respect for the talent. Congratulations to T.J. Lubinsky the producer. Having been brought up in the Bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing I advise you to pick this up today. the performance by Little Anthony and the Imperials on &quot;Two Kinds of People In The World&quot; is worth the price alone. I have played this piece over and over. All the performances are great - buy it - you will be a fan of TJ Lubinsky and his special admiration for what I was lucky and privileged enough to live through. product/productId: B00006HAXW review/userId: A1FRPGQYQTAOR1 review/profileName: Les review/helpfulness: 9/9 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1062979200 review/summary: Marvelous, just Marvelous! review/text: The people who have reviewed this DVD before me have said it all! It is just great! Came across the concert on PBS one night and decided to buy it then and there. After viewing it once I also bought DOO WOP 50 and DOO WOP 51. What a wonderful nostalgic trip to the past! You will never regret buying this DVD. product/productId: B00006HAXW review/userId: A1RSDE90N6RSZF review/profileName: Joseph M.

Remember once these performers are gone, we'll never get to see them again. Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you'll LOVE this DVD !! product/productId: B00006HAXW review/userId: A1OUBOGB5970AO review/profileName: "fellafromnyc" review/helpfulness: 7/7 review/score: 4.0 review/time: 1049846400 review/summary: They sang in the subway, in halls.. review/text: The performance of Little Anthony and the Imperials singing &quot;Two Kinds of People&quot; acappella is worth the price of admission; they haven't lost a step!
