review/time: 1229040000 review/summary: Pretty pointless fictionalization review/text: The murders in Juarez are real. This movie is a badly acted fantasy of revenge and holy intercession.  If there is a good movie about Juarez, I don't know what it is, but it is not this one. product/productId: B003AI2VGA review/userId: AQJVNDW6YZFQS review/profileName: Charles R.

Mexican women are semi-pagan, pious fools. There are self-serving corporate types and even a pushy, culturally-insensitive liberal female reporter.<br /><br />The story is absurd, the characters are unbelievable, the stereotypes are offensive. product/productId: B00006HAXW review/userId: AD4CDZK7D31XP review/profileName: Anthony Accordino review/helpfulness: 64/65 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1060473600 review/summary: A  Rock N Roll History Lesson review/text: Over the past few years, public television has put on a series of vintage &quot;Doo Wop&quot;  and Rock 'N' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless.  This latest dvd &quot;Rock, Rhythm And &quot;Doo Wop&quot;, is a total delight to ones ears.  Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era, when vocal talent was essential, to get a recording contract?  They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology, which enables many modern day artist's with limited ability to survive?  This dvd reads like a who's who of early rock.  The architect of rock, Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of &quot;Keep-A Rockin&quot;, and the line-up that follows, keeps this concert at a premium level of performances.  You get to see and hear Lou Christie, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Joey Dee and the Starliters, Frankie Valli, Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours, just to name a few.  However, nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans?  After singing &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, Jay gave a performance, that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again.  As he prepared to sing &quot;Cara Mia&quot;, he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25, and must now at age 62, hit those same notes?  Hit those notes he did!  Using that opera trained voice, he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it's feet, showering him with a well deserved standing ovation.  If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50's and 60's, this is an absolute must have dvd.  I highly recommend this to everyone, who enjoys those golden oldies. product/productId: B00006HAXW review/userId: A3Q4S5DFVPB70D review/profileName: Joseph P.

I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like, and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning.  It's the best "Oldies" video I've ever seen.  It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60's, and they're still great - Jay and the Americans, Lou Christie, The Five Satins, Little Richard, Kathy Young, Little Anthony, The Fleetwoods, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts.  These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing, and it all shows.  It's a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh, PA, and distributed around the country to donors.  They mention that this was the third concert, and I want ALL of them.  Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced.  The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect, and truly celebrates their works. The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews. product/productId: B00006HAXW review/userId: A2P7UB02HAVEPB review/profileName: "bruce_from_la" review/helpfulness: 24/24 review/score: 5.0 review/time: 1061164800 review/summary: If You Like DooWop You Gotta Have This DVD review/text: Wow!

From the first video, which featured the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the 50s groups, to Doo Wop 51, it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production. Better lighting, better stage layout, and better sound quality.<br />Sadly, in terms of editing, they went overboard this time. Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me. There are times where you can hardly hear the singing, because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud. Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater. It's simply too artificial. We want not only the authentic groups, but also the authentic reaction from who was there. And believe me, we don't need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups.<br />For whoever edited the show, I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups.<br />Is this DVD worth buying? Definately, because groups/singers Fred Parris &amp; The Satins, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, Little Richard, The Limelites, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Bobby Lewis, and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile.<br />I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this, they're a wonderful experience for all ages. product/productId: B00006HAXW
